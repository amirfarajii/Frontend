# Game Contract

Lando game rules are written in solidity programming language. Game rules include several smart contracts that are interconnected. If you qualify for the reward, you will be allowed to withdraw at your request. It is given for more security, we have two tokens in the game, the token is an LND project, and you receive an LND token in the game. You can convert it directly to an LND token after receiving the XLND token, and Sell it at an exchange  or deposit it in a liquidity pool.
