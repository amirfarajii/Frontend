| Level 2 | 5 times  |
| Level 3 | 7 times  |
| Level 4 | 8 times  |

## Free mood

You do not need to have NFT for this part. The game itself gives you characters and guns, and earning money from this part is random, meaning that the more points you earn, the better your chances of receiving a token. The number of times you can play a day is **20** times.



Each time you play, and you are first to third, the game randomly gives between **0** and **100** tokens, and the more points you earn, the more likely you are to get more tokens.
